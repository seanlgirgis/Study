Based on your profile, here are all the confirmed gaps against the Capital One JD:

1. **Scala** — no experience listed anywhere in your profile
2. **Kafka / Real-time streaming** — no streaming experience; your work is entirely batch/ETL based
3. **NoSQL: MongoDB** — not in your profile despite 18+ years of relational DB work
4. **NoSQL: Cassandra** — not in your profile
5. **Distributed microservices** — J2EE/monolithic background only; microservices architecture not present
6. **Gurobi** — optimization solver, not in your profile at all
7. **EMR (AWS Elastic MapReduce)** — you have Glue/Athena/S3/Bedrock but EMR specifically is missing
8. **PySpark/Spark**
9. **Hive/Hadoop**
10. **Snowflake/Redshift**
11. **Databricks**
12. **Data Mesh**
13. **Data Fabric**
14. **Data Lakehouse**
15. **Data Mesh**
16. **Data Fabric**
17. **Data Lakehouse**
18. **Agile**
19. **Docker**
20. **Databricks**
That's **7 gaps** total. The priority order for interview prep would be Kafka → Scala → NoSQL (Mongo/Cassandra) → Microservices → EMR → Gurobi, since that's roughly how heavily the JD weights them.
