    "### LeetCode 560 – Subarray Sum Equals K  \n",
    "**Problem Statement** (exact wording from LeetCode)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return *the total number of subarrays whose sum equals to* `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subarray is a **contiguous** non-empty sequence of elements within an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2\n",
    "Output: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: The subarrays `[1,1]` (indices 0-1) and `[1,1]` (indices 1-2) have sums equal to 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 3\n",
    "Output: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: The subarrays `[1,2]` (indices 0-1) and `[3]` (index 2) have sums equal to 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4`\n",
    "- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`\n",
    "- `-10^7 <= k <= 10^7`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Follow-up / Notes relevant to Capital One/CodeSignal style:**\n",
    "- This is a **frequently reported** Capital One pattern (listed in the roadmap under Phase A.1.2 Prefix Sums → LeetCode 560 Subarray Sum Equals K ⭐).\n",
    "- Optimal solution expected: O(n) time using prefix sums + hash map (not brute force O(n²)).\n",
    "- Edge cases to always test (per roadmap checklist):\n",
    "  - Empty array → 0\n",
    "  - Single element equal to k\n",
    "  - All zeros + k=0\n",
    "  - Negative numbers\n",
    "  - k=0 (subarrays with sum 0)\n",
    "  - Large constraints (n=2e4) → must avoid quadratic time\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a perfect Day 1 drill: builds directly on prefix sums + hashing (your strong areas), and the hash-map complement pattern is very common in easy-medium CodeSignal questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next step in workflow:**\n",
    "- You propose your initial approach / high-level skeleton (pseudocode or comments is fine).\n",
    "- I'll implement a clean, typed, documented, black/ruff/mypy-compliant Python solution.\n",
    "- We'll run it against examples + extra edges (using code_execution if needed).\n",
    "- Add to decisions.md + create Teachables/ entry if a reusable pattern emerges (e.g., \"prefix sum frequency map for subarray sum\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Ready when you are — drop your thoughts / skeleton!  \n",
    "(If you'd rather see a reference solution first or jump to 974 instead, just say so.)"
