    "Since we’ve wrapped up LeetCode 560 (Subarray Sum Equals K) with solid understanding of prefix sums + frequency map, and you’re ready for the **next LeetCode problem**, let’s stay aligned with **Day 1 roadmap focus** from the master document:\n",

    "> **Day 1 (Today)**: Phase A: Arrays, Prefix Sums, Hashing  \n",
    "> LeetCode: 1, 217, 560, 974\n",
    "\n",
    "We already covered 560 deeply.  \n",
    "The next natural progression (and also starred in the roadmap) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**LeetCode 974 – Subarray Sums Divisible by K**  \n",
    "This is a direct evolution: same prefix-sum + hashmap idea, but now we care about remainders (modulo k) instead of exact difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement – LeetCode 974. Subarray Sums Divisible by K\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return *the number of non-empty subarrays that have a sum divisible by* `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subarray is a **contiguous** part of an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: nums = [4,5,0,-2,-3,1], k = 5\n",
    "Output: 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: There are 7 subarrays with a sum divisible by 5:  \n",
    "[5], [5,0], [5,0,-2,-3], [0], [0,-2,-3], [-2,-3], [4,5,0,-2,-3,1] (the whole array)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: nums = [5], k = 9\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "- 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 3 × 10⁴  \n",
    "- -10⁴ ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10⁴  \n",
    "- 2 ≤ k ≤ 10⁴\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this is perfect next step (Capital One relevance)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Listed in roadmap Phase A.1.2 Prefix Sums → **LeetCode 974** ⭐ (Capital One reported)\n",
    "- Reuses the exact same prefix-sum + map pattern we just mastered\n",
    "- Adds one small but important twist: **modulo arithmetic** and handling negative numbers correctly\n",
    "- Medium difficulty — good pacing after 560\n",
    "- Common in CodeSignal-style assessments (hashing + math)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insight Preview (without spoiling the full solution yet)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of looking for `current_prefix - k`,  \n",
    "you look for previous prefixes that have the **same remainder** when divided by k as the current prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because:  \n",
    "if `prefix[j] % k == prefix[i] % k`, then `prefix[j] - prefix[i]` is divisible by k  \n",
    "→ the subarray between i+1 and j has sum divisible by k\n",
    "\n",
    "So the map will store: **remainder → frequency**\n",
    "\n",
    "But: negative numbers can produce negative remainders → we need to normalize them (common gotcha).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your move\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try to adapt the 560 pattern yourself first (pseudocode / comments / skeleton is fine)  \n",
    "   → focus especially on how to handle the modulo and negative remainders\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Or if you want, I can give you the problem constraints + one small example walkthrough (like we did for 560)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Or jump straight to seeing a clean reference implementation after you share your thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "What would you like to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Share your initial approach / skeleton for 974?  \n",
    "- See a small worked example first?  \n",
    "- See the full clean solution right away?  \n",
    "- Switch to a different Day 1 problem (Two Sum #1 or Contains Duplicate #217) for variety?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know — we’re still crushing Day 1 foundations."
