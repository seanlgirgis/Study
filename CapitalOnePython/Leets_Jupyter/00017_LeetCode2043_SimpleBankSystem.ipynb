    "### LeetCode 2043. Simple Bank System\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been tasked with writing a program for a popular bank that will automate all its incoming transactions (transfer, deposit, and withdraw). \n",
    "\n",
    "The bank has `n` accounts numbered from `1` to `n`. The initial balance of each account is given by a **0-indexed** integer array `balance`, where the `(i + 1)th` account has an initial balance of `balance[i]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute all the valid transactions. A transaction is valid if:\n",
    "- The given account number(s) are between `1` and `n`, and\n",
    "- The amount of money withdrawn or transferred from is **less than or equal to** the balance of the account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the `Bank` class:\n",
    "- `Bank(long[] balance)` Initializes the object with the 0-indexed integer array `balance`.\n",
    "- `boolean transfer(int account1, int account2, long money)` Transfers `money` dollars from the account numbered `account1` to the account numbered `account2`. Returns `true` if the transaction was successful, `false` otherwise.\n",
    "- `boolean deposit(int account, long money)` Deposit `money` dollars into the account numbered `account`. Returns `true` if the transaction was successful, `false` otherwise.\n",
    "- `boolean withdraw(int account, long money)` Withdraw `money` dollars from the account numbered `account`. Returns `true` if the transaction was successful, `false` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input\n",
    "[\"Bank\", \"withdraw\", \"transfer\", \"deposit\", \"transfer\", \"withdraw\"]\n",
    "[[[10, 100, 20, 50, 30]], [3, 10], [5, 1, 20], [5, 20], [3, 4, 15], [10, 50]]\n",
    "Output\n",
    "[null, true, true, true, false, false]\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation\n",
    "Bank bank = new Bank([10, 100, 20, 50, 30]);\n",
    "bank.withdraw(3, 10);    // return true, account 3 has 20 - 10 = 10.\n",
    "bank.transfer(5, 1, 20); // return true, account 5 has 30 - 20 = 10, account 1 has 10 + 20 = 30.\n",
    "bank.deposit(5, 20);     // return true, account 5 has 10 + 20 = 30.\n",
    "bank.transfer(3, 4, 15); // return false, account 3 has 10, cannot transfer 15.\n",
    "bank.withdraw(10, 50);   // return false, account 10 does not exist.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "- `n == balance.length`\n",
    "- `1 <= n, account, account1, account2 <= 10^5`\n",
    "- `0 <= balance[i], money <= 10^12`\n",
    "- At most `10^4` calls will be made to each function.\n"
