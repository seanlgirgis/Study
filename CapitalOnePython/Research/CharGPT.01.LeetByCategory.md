Right now, **LeetCode** has **3,000+ coding problems** (it keeps growing every month).

## 🧩 Are they in categories?

Yes — multiple ways to slice them, which is why the site feels organized instead of chaotic.

### 📊 Main category types

#### 1) By Difficulty

* Easy
* Medium
* Hard

#### 2) By Topic (Algorithm / Data Structure)

This is the big one. Problems are tagged, and a single problem can belong to multiple topics.

Common core categories include:

**Data Structures**

* Arrays
* Strings
* Hash Table
* Linked List
* Stack
* Queue
* Heap / Priority Queue
* Tree
* Binary Tree
* Binary Search Tree
* Graph
* Trie
* Matrix

**Algorithms / Techniques**

* Binary Search
* Two Pointers
* Sliding Window
* Recursion
* Backtracking
* Greedy
* Dynamic Programming
* Divide & Conquer
* Bit Manipulation

**Math / Misc**

* Math
* Geometry
* Simulation
* Game Theory
* Randomized

👉 In total, there are roughly **50–60 topic tags** (because some are very specific like “Monotonic Stack”, “Topological Sort”, etc.)

#### 3) By Company

Tagged by companies that asked similar questions:

* Amazon
* Google
* Meta
* Microsoft
* etc.

#### 4) By Study Plans / Tracks

Curated paths like:

* Blind 75
* Top Interview Questions
* Dynamic Programming Study Plan
* Graph Theory Plan

## 🧠 If you're learning Python for interviews

Most people focus on these core ~15 categories first:

* Array
* String
* Hash Map
* Two Pointers
* Sliding Window
* Stack
* Binary Search
* Linked List
* Tree
* Graph
* Heap
* Backtracking
* Greedy
* Dynamic Programming
* Math

Master those → you can solve ~80% of interview questions.
