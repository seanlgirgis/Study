Hi Sean,

Thank you for your interest in the Lead Data Engineer position at Capital One!

To continue in the application process, you'll need to complete a technical assessment offered by CodeSignal. This assessment is your opportunity to demonstrate the technical skills and problem solving abilities required for success in this role at Capital One.

Your assessment must be completed before February 23, 2026 in order for your application to be considered for the role.

The assessment is digitally proctored, meaning you’ll share your camera, microphone, and screen while testing. You’ll need to be in a room where you won’t be disturbed, and no one will enter the camera frame while you’re testing. It’s timed – so try to complete as many tasks as possible within 70 minutes. Once you start the exercise, you must complete it in one sitting. Learn more about CodeSignal’s proctoring here.

We recommend familiarizing yourself with the CodeSignal platform before taking the assessment. You can also review CodeSignal’s candidate preparation FAQs and candidate help center. When you create a CodeSignal account, you must use the same email address that was used for your Capital One application. If you’ve recently completed a CodeSignal assessment, you may have the option to reuse your existing result or retake the assessment.

To complete this assessment, you'll need:

A computer (not a mobile device)
A strong internet connection (download/upload speed of at least 500 kb/s)
An up-to-date web browser (Chrome or Firefox)
A webcam or laptop camera
A microphone
Screen-sharing capability
A government-issued photo ID, to help us verify your identity
