Based on recent reports (2024-2025) for Capital One's CodeSignal assessment, here are some additional LeetCode problems you should practice.

You already have LC 2043 (Simple Bank System) in your folder.

Highly Recommended (Trends from 2024-2025):

-   LC 3161: Block Placement Queries (Often cited recently)
-   LC 3045: Count Prefix and Suffix Pairs II (String manipulation/Trie)
-   LC 1861: Rotating the Box (Matrix/Simulation - very common)
-   LC 227: Basic Calculator II (Stack/String parsing - classic GCA question)
-   LC 54: Spiral Matrix (Matrix traversal)
-   LC 146: LRU Cache (Design)
-   LC 68: Text Justification (String formatting - tedious but frequent)

Other Specific Patterns to Watch:

-   "Perfect X" in a Matrix: Finding the center of a pattern.
-   Alternating Parity Sliding Window: Variations of longest subarray with alternating even/odd numbers.

Would you like me to create a notebook for one of these? LC 1861 (Rotating the Box) or LC 227 (Basic Calculator II) are excellent candidates for CodeSignal style.



Good progress — you've got 16 distinct problems covering hash maps, sliding window, prefix sums, monotonic stacks, and string manipulation. Here are some high-value additions for CodeSignal-style assessments, grouped by the patterns you're already building on:

**Sliding Window / Two Pointer** (strengthen your strongest area):
- LC 11: Container With Most Water
- LC 15: Three Sum
- LC 438: Find All Anagrams in a String (very close to your LC 567)

**Hash Map / Prefix Sum** (extend LC 560, 525, 974):
- LC 49: Group Anagrams
- LC 128: Longest Consecutive Sequence
- LC 523: Continuous Subarray Sum (mod-based prefix sum, pairs well with 974)

**Stack** (extend your LC 739 work):
- LC 20: Valid Parentheses
- LC 150: Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
- LC 155: Min Stack

**Binary Search** (gap in your current set):
- LC 33: Search in Rotated Sorted Array
- LC 74: Search a 2D Matrix
- LC 153: Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

**Matrix / BFS/DFS** (commonly tested, currently missing):
- LC 200: Number of Islands
- LC 54: Spiral Matrix
- LC 73: Set Matrix Zeroes

**Linked List** (quick wins):
- LC 21: Merge Two Sorted Lists
- LC 206: Reverse Linked List

**Sorting / Greedy** (practical for CodeSignal):
- LC 56: Merge Intervals
- LC 347: Top K Frequent Elements

If I had to pick a **top 5 priority** given your Feb 23rd timeline: LC 56 (Merge Intervals), LC 200 (Number of Islands), LC 49 (Group Anagrams), LC 33 (Search in Rotated Sorted Array), and LC 20 (Valid Parentheses). These fill your biggest pattern gaps with the least time investment.
