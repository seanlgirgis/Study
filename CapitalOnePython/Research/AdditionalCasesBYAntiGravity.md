Based on recent reports (2024-2025) for Capital One's CodeSignal assessment, here are some additional LeetCode problems you should practice.

You already have LC 2043 (Simple Bank System) in your folder.

Highly Recommended (Trends from 2024-2025):

-   LC 3161: Block Placement Queries (Often cited recently)
-   LC 3045: Count Prefix and Suffix Pairs II (String manipulation/Trie)
-   LC 1861: Rotating the Box (Matrix/Simulation - very common)
-   LC 227: Basic Calculator II (Stack/String parsing - classic GCA question)
-   LC 54: Spiral Matrix (Matrix traversal)
-   LC 146: LRU Cache (Design)
-   LC 68: Text Justification (String formatting - tedious but frequent)

Other Specific Patterns to Watch:

-   "Perfect X" in a Matrix: Finding the center of a pattern.
-   Alternating Parity Sliding Window: Variations of longest subarray with alternating even/odd numbers.

Would you like me to create a notebook for one of these? LC 1861 (Rotating the Box) or LC 227 (Basic Calculator II) are excellent candidates for CodeSignal style.
