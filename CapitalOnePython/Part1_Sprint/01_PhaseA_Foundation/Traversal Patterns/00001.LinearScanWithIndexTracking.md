**Date: February 13, 2026**  
**Session: Day 1 – Phase A.1.1 Traversal Patterns**

### A.1.1 Traversal Patterns – Focus today  
Linear scan with index tracking  
→ Most basic (and most frequent) way questions start in easy Q1 / Q2.  
You scan the array once (O(n)), while keeping track of **where you are** (index i), **what came before** (i-1), or **some running state**.

Common flavors seen in Capital One / CodeSignal style:
- Compare each element with its previous one
- Track position of last seen something
- Build result while scanning (e.g. count streaks, find first/last match)
- Use index to access neighbors or compute something position-dependent

### Practice Problem – Test-style version  
(Exactly the kind of clean, concise wording you’ll see in Q1/Q2)

**Problem: Consecutive Increasing Streak**

Given an array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest **consecutive increasing streak** in the array.

A consecutive increasing streak is a sequence of adjacent elements where each element is **strictly greater** than the previous one.

- If the array is empty, return 0.
- Single element arrays should return 1.
- The streak must be made of **adjacent** elements (contiguous subarray).

**Example 1:**  
Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 4, 7]  
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest consecutive increasing streak is [1, 3, 5] (length 3). [4, 7] is length 2.

**Example 2:**  
Input: nums = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]  
Output: 1  
Explanation: No two adjacent elements are strictly increasing.

**Example 3:**  
Input: nums = [1]  
Output: 1

**Example 4:**  
Input: nums = []  
Output: 0

**Example 5:**  
Input: nums = [10, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 7]  
Output: 4  
Explanation: [9, 11, 12, 13] is the longest streak.

**Constraints:**
- 0 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10⁴
- -10⁴ ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10⁴

**Your task:**  
Write a function in Python that solves this.

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def longestIncreasingStreak(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Your code here
        pass
```

### Instructions for you (simulate real test conditions)
1. Time yourself — aim for **under 12 minutes** (ideally 6–10 min)
2. Do **not** look up anything — pretend it's proctored
3. Handle all edge cases you can think of
4. Write clean code with:
   - Type hints
   - Docstring (brief)
   - Early return for empty / trivial cases
5. Use linear scan + index tracking (do **not** use recursion or extra data structures unless necessary)

When you're done (or stuck), paste your solution here.

I'll:
- Run it against hidden test cases using code_execution
- Check style (black/ruff/mypy level)
- Point out missed edges
- Show optimal pattern variation if yours can be cleaner/faster
